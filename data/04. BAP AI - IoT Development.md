Rental car Platform using digital key control system

# Pain points

1. Manage a range of devices, all unified under a digital key service in low quality and high costs with a Japanese vendor's software (SDK, API, mobile apps, cloud)

# Solution

- Provide expert consultation on integrating the application with the Digital Key Box SDK via web technologies (React.js, PHP) and mobile applications (React Native)
- Develop a SaaS platform that integrates with Digital Key, enabling clients and end-users to interact seamlessly with the digital key
- Optimize running costs using AWS Lambda functions for the backend and implement CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and testing
- Develop monitoring APIs and error logging systems to ensure continuous notifications and real-time issue tracking|TAlROE-w)|JT|

Track record of trend detection on social networks

# Overview:

- Input: A dataset comprising Facebook posts from top fan pages in Vietnam at a given time.
- Output: Identification of the most popular trends and associated keywords on Facebook in Vietnam during that period.

# Solution:

- This challenge is addressed through the application of LDA topic modeling techniques.
- By employing an effective web crawler and refining topic modeling methodologies, it becomes feasible to monitor trending topics on Facebook and other social networks on an hourly or even minute-by-minute basis.
- LDA, a probabilistic model, effectively identifies patterns and topic distributions within a given corpus of documents.

Human Detection Performance

A step-by-step guide for semantic segmentation using the DeepLab model on a sample input image. The result displays a semantic label superimposed on the original image.

Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling

Utilizing Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling, four parallel convolutions with varying dilation rates are applied to the feature map.

The resulting features from all branches are concatenated and passed through a 1 × 1 convolution (with 256 filters and batch normalization), followed by a final 1 × 1 convolution.

How to segment objects for each frame:

Collect training data and load the latest version of a pre-trained DeepLab model (TensorFlow-supported).
Load color maps from the PASCAL VOC dataset.
Assign colors to various labels (e.g., pink for people, green for bicycles).
Visualize images and apply color overlays to different regions.
